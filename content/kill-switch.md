## Good things we did
- We put our kill switch above and to the left of the steering wheel along the roll cage - we rotated the kill switch further out so that it wouldn't intefere with gloved hands moving along the steering wheel.

## Fumbles
- The FIA rated kill switch had a suprisingly long lead time - average lead time was 1 or 2 weeks. *do not wait to order this*.
- We wired it wrong the Z switch at first -- assumed the red wire going into the ignition was +12V, but in reality the white wire was +12V. Before performing a kill switch test we sanity checked all the voltages we was expecting to see, and we got 0V on a line that was supposed to be hot. So we knew something was wired wrong
