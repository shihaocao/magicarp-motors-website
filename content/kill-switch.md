- 10 gauge wire (10 ft)
- 6.3mm spade connectors
- FIA Kill Switch
- Butt Splice Connectors

## Tools
- Wire Crimpers
- 2 Gauge Large Wire Crimpers
- Electrical Tape

## Helpful Links
These two links helped me figure out how to wire things

## Good things we did
- We put our kill switch above and to the left of the steering wheel along the roll cage - we rotated the kill switch further out so that it wouldn't intefere with gloved hands moving along the steering wheel.

## Fumbles
- The FIA rated kill switch had a suprisingly long lead time - average lead time was 1 or 2 weeks. *do not wait to order this*.
- I wired it wrong the Z switch at first -- assumed the red wire going into the ignition was +12V, but in reality the white wire was +12V. Before performing a kill switch test I sanity checked all the voltages I was expecting to see, and I got 0V on a line that was supposed to be hot. So I knew something was wired wrong
