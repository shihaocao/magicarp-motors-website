# Tires
Hanhook Ventus R-S4
- Set of 4, we ordered from tire rack.
- Installed at the local garage.
- 1 week lead

# Thunderhill Race
Tires heat up a lot. Get the PSI of the tires down to `32/33`. Assume that the heat of the asphalt and running will bring the tire internal PSI up to `35` on track. Our car is `FWD`, so you if the fronts read lower before going out on track, that's fine (don't waste too much time pumping to target pressures).

If you're paranoid, measure the PSI right as the car comes back from track, the temperatures should still be relatively accurate.

- Thread finds that RS-4 lasts longer, and still performs ok in the wet.

### Pressures?
- You may want _higher_ pressures when there's a lot of standing water on track. This may help _evacuate_ water as it keeps the center of the tread elevated, and allows pushing from the center.
- You may want _lower_ pressures when the track is moist/wet. Softer tires allow more tire deformation and will help keep the operating temperatures of the tires up.

Verdict:
- Most of the time, the track is just _wet_ err on the side of pumping down.
