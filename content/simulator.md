# Sonoma Practice
_Note: this assumes someone has already set up things for you_

Look at this map: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonoma_Raceway#/media/File:Sonoma_Raceway_2024.svg]

1. Open my laptop, windows pin is `redacted`, see discord
2. Launch Assetto Corsa -> Go to `drive`
3. Hit `hot lap`
4. Choose `Alfa Romeo Giulietta QV`
   1. (after 1 hr, switch to the `Toyota Carina`)
5. Choose `Sonoma WTCC` (not rp layout) for track
6. Start
7. With the car on the screen/pit lane, hit the wheel in the top left to actually start racing.
8. Hit the gas and go.
   1. Be sure to watch you `MPH` in corners, and listen for when the tires are squealing.

# High level tips
- hit your apex, and especially before another turn, consider aiming for _late_ apexes. IE turn `2.1` into `2.2`
- be gentle with the steering, do not change the steering quickly this will upset the car
- be gentle with getting on and off the gas/brakes. this will also upset the car

# Hardware Setup
- Make sure the eGPU is plugged in
- Make sure the Fanatec is plugged in _and on_ before Assetto Corsa is launched.

# Install
Must haves:
- https://assettocorsa.club/content-manager.html
  - You don't need to use this as the launcher, but it will also install the `Custom Shaders Patch` along side, which will give you the `out of bounds` detection (I think?) which is important for practicing.
- Fanatec App to get the drivers for the sim wheel and pedals
- Assetto Corsa, purchased on steam
  - The first time you play, open up the `controls` menu and go through the `wheel` setup `wizard`
    - Be sure to read the instructions carefully. Do not release pedals until instructed to.
- Track:
  - TODO link
- Cars:
  - [https://www.assettoworld.com/car/toyota-carina-ed-st200-201-v-type-rus-spec]
    - This car is nice for us because it is FWD and it has a 4 speed gearbox -- which matches our 1997 Avalon

# X1C + eGPU notes
If the eGPU is not detecting, do not start by installing the `Nvidia App`, start by installing the latest windows Nvidia GPU driver, and then hit the check box to install the `App` alongside.
