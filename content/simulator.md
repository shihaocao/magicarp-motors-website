# Sonoma Practice
_Note: this assumes someone has already set up things for you_

Look at this map: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonoma_Raceway#/media/File:Sonoma_Raceway_2024.svg]

1. Open the desktop, the Windows pin is `redacted`, see discord
2. Launch Assetto Corsa -> Go to `drive`
3. Hit `hot lap`
4. Choose `Alfa Romeo Giulietta QV`
5. Choose `Sonoma WTCC` (not rp layout) for track
6. Start
7. With the car on the screen/pit lane, hit the wheel in the top left to actually start racing.
8. Shift into 1st, hit the gas and go.
   1. Be sure to watch you `MPH` in corners, and listen for when the tires are squealing.

_NOTE: The 92 accord does have ABS, but does not have Traction Control. Run with Factory ABS, and NO traction control_

# As you are driving
- If you take too much damage to your gearbox, the shifting will become slower and unreliable. You should hit `ESC` and `restart the session`.
- If you money shift, the engine will take damage. Hit `ESC` and `restart`.

# High level tips
- hit your apex, and especially before another turn, consider aiming for _late_ apexes. IE turn `2.1` into `2.2`
- be gentle with the steering, do not change the steering quickly this will upset the car
- be gentle with getting on and off the gas/brakes. this will also upset the car

# February Notes
- We should start practice against bots.
  - To do race practice, hit the `Race`->`Quick Race` Selector at the top, and it should already be pre-populated with fast cars.
- We should practice with the `Accord`.

# Buttons
- The top left button on the wheel is `look left`
- The top right button on the wheel is `look right`
- The bottom right button on the wheel is `look behind you`
- The biddle right button on the wheel is `change views`

# FAQ
- The screen is all white and glaring:
  - To fix this, change the weather of the race to `heavy clouds` this will have the rendering engine not think about reflections too much.
- I can't hear any sound. Turn on the bluetooth dongle at the top right of the left desk -- it should auto connect.
- The wheel isn't giving force feedback:
  - The wheel must be turned on (yellow light on, not red) at the base of the wheel bottom right side **before the game is booted**

# Install
Must haves:
- https://assettocorsa.club/content-manager.html
  - You don't need to use this as the launcher, but it will also install the `Custom Shaders Patch` along side, which will give you the `out of bounds` detection (I think?) which is important for practicing.
- Fanatec App to get the drivers for the sim wheel and pedals
- Assetto Corsa, purchased on steam
  - The first time you play, open up the `controls` menu and go through the `wheel` setup `wizard`
    - Be sure to read the instructions carefully. Do not release pedals until instructed to.

    - This car is nice for us because it is FWD and it has a 4 speed gearbox -- which matches our 1997 Avalon
